This project was about calculating compound interest and displaying the interest amount with or without monthly deposit accumulated over the years. The program display
how much interest earned and total amount in the bank account every year depends on how many years accumulation user would like to know. I was able to make this project
more modular and more readable for other programmers. One thing I can improve in my code, It is to write much cleaner code and less error prone program. The difficult
part I found was to write show Bank balance with monthly deposit, I was having a hard time integrating the function I wrote into the program. I used google and read C++ documentation to overcome this obstacle. The skills that can be transferrable to other projects are Object Oriented Programming, In-line commenting, and writing 
functions to make main class less clutter. To make my code more maintable, readable, and adaptable, I use the Standard C++ Styling. I added in-line comments to help other programmers understand the code.
